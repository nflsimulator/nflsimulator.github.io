 <h1 class="title">Basics of Java</h1>
 <br>
          <p>So you want to learn java. You might be programming for the first time or you might already know another language.
              Why should I learn Java, you may ask yourself. Beause over 5 billion devices all over the world have some kind of Java program in them.
               If you know Java, you pretty much know the basics to many more languages.
               At first it may seem intimidating but it gets easier after you learn the basics. 
                Java is a great language to learn for everybody (including beginners). So let's not waste any time and dive straight into the basics.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Hello World</h1>
<br>
    <p> The most basic beginner program that you can write is the "Hello World" one. All the program does is print "hello world". So how do you do it? All you need to do is 
            write System.out.println("Hello World");. You might see that there is a code segment written below this that prints hello world. Try running it and see what
            happens. Try changing the words in the "" and see what prints out. For this level, just look at the line above it as a placeholder. The place that you write 
            code under. Also, look at the first line as the name of our program. Without it, you are just writing text, not code.
                </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h1> Curly Brackets{} and semi colons ;</h1>
    <br>
    <p>You might of barely ever used these little squiggly lines, but in Computer science, they are essential. They tell the program where methods, if/for/while statements
    , classes, etc end. You might not know what the things I stated are, but just know that they are important. Every opening curly bracket needs a closing one. The 
following code has an error. Can you find and fix it? (HINT: It involves a curly brace {}). Answer is below the code segment. </p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p> If you guessed to put another closing curly brace at the bottom, you are correct.</p>
<br> 
<h2> Semi Colons</h2>
<br>
<p> Semi colons are used at the end of every statement to tell the computer to move on to the next line. You don't use semi colons when writing a loop or if statement 
    but that is a little more advanced stuff. For now, write a semi colon after every line of code.
</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Data types</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
          <p> You've learned how to print text and the basics about curly brackets. Now it's time to learn about data types. A data type stores data in a name.

          </p>
          <h2> Ints and doubles</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Ints and doubles are primitive data types that store numerical values. Ints can store any whole number while doubles store decimal numbers. 
              You will get an error if you try to put a decimal in an int, but you will not get an error if you try to put an int in a double. The double automatically
              puts a .0 after the int. Ints and doubles are the fundamental stepping stone for programming. The ways you can use them is 
              innumerable. Here's how you declare an int and a double.
          </p>

          <br>
          <h2> Strings and chars</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Strings and chars are data types that store characters. Chars can only store one character like "L" while strings can store whatever you want them to.
              So to think of it, A String is just a bunch of chars. You declare them like this String name="whatever you want it to store." You declare a char like 
              char name= 'A'. Just remember when creating a String, you need quotitation marks "" and a char needs an apostrophe. The following code may look confusing 
              at first but look at it line by line.
          </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h2> Booleans</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p> The boolean might be the most simple data type. It either stores true or false (Nothing more). It might be useful if you're making a game 
              and you have a boolean called "isalive" which is true if the character is alive and false when it isn't. Try creating booleans and printing them.
          </p>
          <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1> Loops </h1>
<br>
<p> Now that we know what the basic data types are, let's learn about loops! A loop is a code that is repeated until a certain condition is met.
    There are two basic types of loops that you need to know while loops and for loops. While loops do the code inside of them until a condition is met.
</p>
<br>
    <h2> The While Loop</h2>  
   <p> The while loop does a portion of code until the statement in front of it is false. Example down Below: </p>

 <input type="radio" id="12345" value="12345">
